hi, api is simlimar to ramda.
Just started to make it.
Yes, I know, it's not a superfresh idea,
     but I want to try, and you can switch later, due to similar api.
It should be smallest possible ramda alternative.
Maybe even not drop-in replacement.

Later on:
To load unsafe use smth like `import { reduce } from 'pepka/unsafe'`.
It's faster, but mutates data.
